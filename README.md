- **Road Construction:** Players can create roads using snap points for measurable and optimal placement.
- **Building Placement:** Houses, schools, hospitals, and windmills can be strategically positioned.
- **Admin Panel:** Allows government officials to visualize rural development metrics like literacy and healthcare scores.
- **Environmental Considerations:** Proximity of industrial areas to residential zones is analyzed.
- **Water Management:** Players can place wells and handpumps to ensure water accessibility.

### 📊 **Data-Driven Decision Making**
- **Literacy Score:** Percentage of houses connected to schools.
- **Healthcare Score:** Accessibility of hospitals from residential areas.
- **Infrastructure Score:** Evaluates placement efficiency for roads and buildings.
- **Taxation System:** Helps optimize fund allocation for rural development.

### 🎮 **Gameplay Mechanics**
- Touch-based **road creation** using snap-points.
- **Agricultural Land Classification** by marking lands as **residential, industrial, or agricultural**.
- **In-game missions** to educate villagers about government schemes.
